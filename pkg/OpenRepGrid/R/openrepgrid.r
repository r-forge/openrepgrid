#' \pkg{OpenRepGrid}: an R package for the analysis of repertory grids.
#' The \pkg{OpenRepGrid} package provides tools for the analysis of repertory grid data.
#' The repertory grid is a method devised by George Alexander Kelly
#' in his seminal work "The Psychology of Personal Constructs" published in 1955.
#' The repertory grid has been used in and outside the context of Personal Construct 
#' Psychology (PCP) in a broad range of fields. For an introduction into the 
#' technique see e.g. Fransella, Bell and Bannister (2003).

#' \pkg{OpenRepGrid}: internal functions overview for developers.
#' This page is a help for developers: these functions are usually 
#' not needed by the casual user. The internal functions have a twofold goal
#' 1) to provide means for advanced numerical grid analysis and 2) 
#' to facilitate function development. The function for these purposes
#' are internal, i.e. they are not visible in the package documentation.
#' Nonetheless they do have a documentation that
#' can be accesses in the same way as for other functions.
#' More in the details section.
#' 
#' \bold{Functions for advanced grid analysis} \cr \cr
#' The package provides functions to facilitate numerical research for grids. 
#' These comprise the generation of random data, permutation of grids etc. 
#' to facilitate Monte Carlo simulations, batch analysis of grids and other methods. 
#' With R as an underlying framework, the results of grid analysis easily lend 
#' themselves to further statistical processing and analysis within R. 
#' This is one of the central advantages for researchers compared to other 
#' standard grid software. The following table lists several functions for these purposes.
#'
#' \tabular{ll}{
#' \code{\link{randomGrid}}                       \tab  \cr
#' \code{\link{randomGrids}}                      \tab  \cr
#' \code{\link{permuteConstructs}}                \tab  \cr
#' \code{\link{permuteGrid}}                      \tab  \cr
#' \code{\link{quasiDistributionDistanceSlater}}  \tab  \cr
#' }
#'
#' \bold{Modules for function development} \cr \cr
#' Beside the advanced analysis feature the developer's functions comprise 
#' low-level modules to create new functions for grid analysis. 
#' Though the internal structure of a repgrid object in R is simple 
#' (type e.g. \code{str(bell2010, 2)} to get an impression), it is convenient 
#' to not have to deal with access on this level. Several function like e.g. 
#' \code{getElementNames} are convenient wrappers that perform standard tasks 
#' needed when implementing new functions. The following table lists several 
#' functions for these purposes.
#'
#' \tabular{ll}{
#' \code{\link{getRatingLayer}}       \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getNoOfConstructs}}    \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getNoOfElements}}      \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getScale}}             \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getScaleMidpoint}}     \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getConstructNames}}    \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getConstructNames2}}   \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{getElementNames}}      \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{bindConstructs}}       \tab    \cr
#' \code{\link{doubleEntry}}          \tab    \cr
