\title{OpenRepGrid: an R package for the analysis of repertory grids.}
\description{\pkg{OpenRepGrid}: an R package for the analysis of repertory grids.
The \pkg{OpenRepGrid} package provides tools for the analysis of repertory grid data.
The repertory grid is a method devised by George Alexander Kelly
in his seminal work "The Psychology of Personal Constructs" published in 1955.
The repertory grid has been used in and outside the context of Personal Construct 
Psychology (PCP) in a broad range of fields. For an introduction into the 
technique see e.g. Fransella, Bell and Bannister (2003).}
\author{Currently the \pkg{OpenRepGrid} development team is Mark Heckmann. 
Everyone who is interested in developing the package is invited to join.

The \pkg{OpenRepGrid} package is developed at R-Forge (\url{http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/openrepgrid/}).
The R-Forge site provides information and mailing lists for help queries and bug reports. 
Bug reports can also be emailed to the package maintainer or issued on 
\url{http://www.openrepgrid.org} under section \emph{Suggestions/issues}.
The package maintainer at R-Forge is Mark Heckmann  <heckmann(at)uni-bremen.de>.}
\note{To get started with \pkg{OpenRepGrid} visit the project's home under \url{www.openrepgrid.org}. 
On this site you will find tutorials, explanation about the theory, methods of analysis and 
the according R code.

To see the preferable citation of the \pkg{OpenRepGrid} package, type

It is work in progress and is continuously being improved by hopefully 
numerous contributors. It may contain bugs and errors.
