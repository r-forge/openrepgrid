\description{Align constructs using the ideal element to gain pole preferences.
The direction of the constructs in a grid is arbitrary and a reflection of 
a scale does not affect the information contained in the grid. 
Nonetheless, the direction of a scale has an effect on inter-element 
correlations (Mackay, 1992) and on the spatial representation and clustering
of the grid (Bell, 2010). Hence, it is desirable to follow a protocol to 
align constructs that will render unique results. A common approach is
to align constucts by pole preference, i. e. aligninig all positive and  
negative poles. This can e. g. be achieved using \code{\link{swapPoles}}.
If an ideal element is present, this element can be used to identify
the positive and negative pole. The function \code{alignByIdeal} will
align the constructs accordingly. Note that this approach does not always 
yield definite results as sometimes ratings do not show a clear 
preference for one pole (Winter, Bell & Watson, 2010).
If a preference cannot be determined definitely,
the construct direction remains unchanged (a warning is issued in that case).}

on the left side.}
