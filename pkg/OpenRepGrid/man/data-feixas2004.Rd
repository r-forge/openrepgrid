\description{Grid data from Feixas and Saul (2004). A desription by the authors:
"When Teresa, 22 years old, was seen by the second author (LAS) at the 
psychological services of the University of Salamanca, she was in the 
final year of her studies in chemical sciences. Although Teresa proves 
to be an excellent student, she reveals serious doubts about her self worth. 
She cries frequently, and has great difficulty in meeting others, 
even though she has a boyfriend who is extremely supportive. Teresa 
is anxiously hesitant about accepting a new job which would involve moving 
to another city 600 Km away from home." (Feixas & Saul, 2004, p. 77).}
