\description{Hartmann (1992) showed in a Monte Carlo study that Slater distances
(see \code{\link{distanceSlater}}) based on random grids, for 
which Slater coined the expression quasis, have a skewed distribution,
a mean and a standard deviation depending on the number 
of constructs elicited. He suggested a linear transformation (z-transformation) 
which takes into account the estimated (or expected) mean and 
the standard deviation 
of the derived distribution to standardize Slater distance scores 
across different grid sizes. 'Hartmann distances' represent
a more accurate version of 'Slater distances'. Note that Hartmann distances
are multiplied by -1. Hence, negative Hartmann values represent 
dissimilarity, i.e. a big Slater distance.  \cr  \cr
The function \code{distanceHartmann}
conducts a small Monte Carlo simulation for the supplied grid.
I. e. a number of quasis of the same size and with the same scale range
as the grid under investigation are generated. A distrubution of
Slater distances derived from the quasis is calculated and used for
Hartmann's standardization.    \cr  \cr
It is also possible to return the quantiles of the sample distribution
and only the element distances consideres 'significant'
according to the quantiles defined.}
\details{The 'Hartmann distance' is calculated as follows (Hartmann 1992, p. 49).       \cr
\deqn{D = -1 (\frac{D_{slater} - M_c}{sd_c})}{D = -1 (D_slater - M_c / sd_c)}
Where \eqn{D_{slater}}{D_slater} denotes the Slater distances of the grid,
\eqn{M_c}{M_c} the sample distribution's mean value and 
\eqn{sd_c}{sd_c} the sample distributions's standard deviation.}
\value{A matrix containing Hartmann distances (\code{output=1}
and \code{output=2})

\arguments{\item{x}{\code{repgrid} object.}
\item{rep}{Number of random grids to generate to produce
sample distribution for Slater distances
(default is \code{100}). Note that
a lot of samples may take a while to calculate. Set 
\code{progress = TRUE} to monitor progress for 
large samples.}
\item{meantype}{The type of mean to use for standardization.
\code{meantype=1} will use the empirical mean 
(which is 1 and the default)
\code{meantype=2} will use the expected mean, 
i. e. 1.}
\item{quant}{The propabities of the quantiles from the 
Slater distance distribution that will be returned.
The default is \code{c(.05, .5, .95)}. This corresponds
to the lower 5 \%, the mean and the upper 5 \% of the
distribution.}
\item{significant}{Whether to only show values that are outside the quantiles
defined in \code{quant}, i.e. onsidered as 'significant'
(default is \code{FALSE}.)
The first and last value of \code{quant} is used
to determine the indifference region. This options only applies
when \code{output == 1} is used.}
\item{trim}{The number of characters a element names are trimmed to (default is
\code{10}). If \code{NA} no trimming is done. Trimming
simply saves space when displaying the output.}
\item{indexcol}{Logical. Whether to add an extra index column so the 
column names are indexes instead of element names. This option 
renders a neater output as long element names will stretch 
the output (default is \code{FALSE}). Note that the index column
is the first matrix column.}
\item{digits}{Numeric. Number of digits to round to (default is 
\code{2}).}
\item{output}{The output type. The default (\code{output=1}) will print
the Hartmann distances, \code{output=2} the Slater 
and \code{output=3} both distances to the console.
\code{output=0} will suppress the printing to the console.
In all cases a list containig the results of the calculations
is returned invisibly. See value for details.}
\item{progress}{Whether to show a progress bar (default is \code{TRUE}).
May be useful when the distribution is estimated on the basis
of many quasis.}
\item{upper}{Logical. Whether to display only upper part of the distance matrix
(default \code{TRUE}).}
