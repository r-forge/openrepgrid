\description{Internal parser for sci:vesco files (suffix \code{scires}).}
\value{a list with extracted parameters.}
\note{Sci:Vesco offers the options to rate the construct poles seperately or using
a bipolar scale. The seperated rating is done using the "tetralemma" field.
The field is a bivariate plane on which each of the four (tetra) corners  
has a different meaning in terms of rating. Using this approach also allows ratings
like: "both poles apply", "none of the poles apply" and all intermediate ratings
can be chosen. This relaxes the bipolarity assumption often assumed in grid theory and
allows for deviation from a strict bipolar rating if the constructs are not applied
in a bipolar way. Using the tetralemma field for rating requires to analyze
each construct seperately though. This means we get a double entry grid where the 
emergent and constrast pole ratings might not simply be a reflection of on another.
If a tetralemma field has been used for rating, \code{OpenRepGrid} offers the option 
to transform the scores into "normal" grid ratings (i.e. restricted to bipolarity)
by projecting the ratings from the bivariate tetralemma field onto the diagonal 
of the tetralemma field and thus forcing a bipolar rating type. This option is 
not recommended due to the fact that the conversion is susceptible to error
when both ratings are near to zero.}
