\description{Percentage of Variance Accounted for by the First Factor (PVAFF) is used as 
a measure of cognitive complexity. It was introduced in an unpublished
PhD thesis by Jones (1954, cit. Bonarius, 1965).
To calculate it, the 'first factor' is extracted from the construct 
correlation matrix by principal component analysis.
The PVAFF reflects the amount of variation that is accounted for by a single 
linear component. If a single latent component is able to explain the
variation in the grid, the cognitive complexity is said to be low. 
In this case the construct system is regarded as 'simple' (Bell, 2003).}
\details{The percentage of variance is calculated using the corelation matrix
of te constructs submitted to \code{\link{princomp}}.
TODO: Results have not yet been checked against other grid programs.}
\value{Numeric.}
